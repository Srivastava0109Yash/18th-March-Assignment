These methods are built into the machine learning algorithm and aim to identify the most relevant features for the task at hand. Some common techniques used in embedded feature selection methods are:\n",

    "- Decision trees:<br> Decision trees are machine learning algorithms that recursively split the dataset into subsets based on the most informative features. The split criteria are based on information gain or Gini impurity, which measure the degree of homogeneity of the target variable within each subset. Decision trees can be used for feature selection by examining the importance of each feature in the tree.\n",

    "- Random forests:<br> Random forests are ensemble learning algorithms that combine multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and stability of the predictions. Random forests can also be used for feature selection by calculating the importance of each feature in the forest. The importance is measured by the decrease in accuracy of the forest when a feature is removed.\n",
